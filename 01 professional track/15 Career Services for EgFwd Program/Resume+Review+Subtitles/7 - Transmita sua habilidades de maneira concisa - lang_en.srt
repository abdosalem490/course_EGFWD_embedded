1
00:00:00,612 --> 00:00:05,129
Not all job applications are the same,
but they all require a resume.

2
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:08,650
It's not something you work on for
only 30 minutes and leave it at that.

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,429
You should continually build and
refine it throughout your career.

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,410
I love editing my resume.

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,320
I've worked on my resume every now and
then for

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,140
years, and
it's really motivating for me to see

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,349
how I've grown in my career whenever
I add new experiences or skills.

8
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:25,660
Every resume will be unique.

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,390
However, there are still industry
standards you have to meet,

10
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,510
depending on the type of job.

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,119
The industry standards we'll
discuss in this lesson,

12
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,799
are specific to careers in the US and
Canada.

13
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:38,979
But even if you don't want a job in
these countries, this lesson will still

14
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:41,609
be valuable for you because of
the techniques you learned,

15
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:43,339
which are applicable to all resumes.

16
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:47,669
Don't get caught up in the differences
between what a resume looks

17
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,880
like in the US or
what it looks like in Germany or India.

18
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,219
For example, in the US,
it's not normal to have a picture or

19
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:55,859
a marital status on your resume.

20
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:57,519
In Germany, it is normal.

21
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,140
This is not what you should focus on.

22
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,460
What will be important
are the techniques you'll learn to

23
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,450
communicate something very complex,
your professional and educational

24
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:09,000
experiences, in a concise manner
that is targeted to a specific job.

25
00:01:10,055 --> 00:01:12,715
Changing the personal information
in your resume to fit

26
00:01:12,715 --> 00:01:14,895
different country's standards is easy.

27
00:01:14,894 --> 00:01:19,265
Distilling three years of work into
four short bullet points is not easy.

28
00:01:19,265 --> 00:01:21,855
And that is one of the many topics
we'll cover in the resume lesson
