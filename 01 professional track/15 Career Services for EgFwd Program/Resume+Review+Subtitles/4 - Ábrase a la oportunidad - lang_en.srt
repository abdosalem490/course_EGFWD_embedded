00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,580
Last but not least, a vital part of your
job search is to be open to opportunity

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,879
and continually reevaluate
your own job requirements.

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,450
When I moved back to Silicon Valley I
didn’t intend to work in tech, but

4
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:14,820
here I am and I’m very happy.

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,160
This all happened because I had an open
mind to opportunities that came my way.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,079
If an opportunity is interesting,
give it a shot.

7
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:22,899
It may turn out to be your dream job.
