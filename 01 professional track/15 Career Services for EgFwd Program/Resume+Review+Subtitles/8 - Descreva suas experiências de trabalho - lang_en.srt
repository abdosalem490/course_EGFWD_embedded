1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,890
When describing your work experience,

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,810
which includes your projects,
you'll want to portray three things.

3
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:08,679
One is action.

4
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:12,589
An employer only wants you if you can
complete work assignments, multitask,

5
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:13,490
and deliver results.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,250
That is why your bullet points
should begin with action verbs.

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,330
Second is numbers.

8
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:23,481
Whenever you can,
describe your work quantitatively.

9
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,983
This is the best way to provide
evidence of your skills.

10
00:00:26,983 --> 00:00:31,519
Leading a team of ten people is more
impressive than just leading a team.

11
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,582
Producing work that brought a 30%
increase in revenue is more impressive

12
00:00:35,582 --> 00:00:37,299
than just increasing profits.

13
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:43,769
The third is success, sometimes you
can't attach numbers to where you work.

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,090
Perhaps what you did
was not quantifiable or

15
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,080
the work you did is classified.

16
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,850
However, you can always
showcase success,

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,240
even if you didn't achieve
what you wanted to.

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,859
Improving efficiency is a success.

19
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:59,759
Trying something new and
learning from it, is a success.

20
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,310
So, after you draft your bullet points,
ask yourself if they portray action,

21
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,129
numbers, and success.

22
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:07,909
You'll be able to see the difference,
even if it's subtle.
