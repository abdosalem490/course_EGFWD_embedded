1
00:00:00,706 --> 00:00:01,841
Now for the easy part.

2
00:00:01,842 --> 00:00:05,131
The conclusion is both the shortest
part of your letter, and

3
00:00:05,131 --> 00:00:07,724
the hiring manager's
last impression of you.

4
00:00:07,724 --> 00:00:11,208
Briefly restate why you want,
and why you're a good fit for

5
00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:12,542
this particular job.

6
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:16,407
Remember to state any logistics, for
example, if you are currently out of

7
00:00:16,407 --> 00:00:19,983
town and will not be able to interview
in person until a certain date.

8
00:00:19,983 --> 00:00:23,667
And of course, include a thank you for
the recruiter's time and consideration.

9
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:26,040
Humility and
gratitude can go a long way.
