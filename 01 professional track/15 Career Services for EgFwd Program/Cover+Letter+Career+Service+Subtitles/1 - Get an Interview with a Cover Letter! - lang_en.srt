00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,980
Welcome to our lesson on
cover letter writing.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:07,029
Sometimes called a motivation letter or
letter of intent, a cover letter,

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,589
is a way to introduce
yourself to an employer and

4
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:13,699
tell them in your own words why
you're the best person for the job.

5
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:16,809
In the past, cover letters accompanied
resumes when the applicant

6
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:19,769
physically mailed or
faxed in their job application.

7
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:22,899
Nowadays, for the most part,
they still accompany resumes but

8
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:23,779
in online submission.

9
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:27,669
A cover letter may manifest
itself in different ways.

10
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,810
Sometimes a cover letter is required,
sometimes they are expected but

11
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:33,250
optional.

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,000
Sometimes they are optional and
they may not look like a letter.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,869
When I applied to Udacity,
I submitted a cover letter.

14
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:43,309
However, I have co-workers who didn't
submit any additional information, or

15
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,469
wrote a short paragraph
instead of full pledge letter.

16
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:49,789
Sometimes, a cover letter isn't
expected or requested at all, but

17
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:52,089
you still need to write
a sure introduction.

18
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,020
In the past three years,
I've applied to jobs with all four

19
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,980
of these types of cover
letter requirements.

20
00:00:56,979 --> 00:00:58,769
And I opted to submit
a letter to all of them.

21
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,480
I didn't write any of them from scratch,
but

22
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:04,189
edited a copy of a letter I had been
working on throughout my professional

23
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,969
experience, beginning from when
I applied to my first ever job.

24
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:10,840
Although I didn't get an offer
from every job I applied to,

25
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,469
I did get an in-person interview for
over 75% of them.

26
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:16,530
Cover letters really help.

27
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,349
After this lesson,

28
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:21,349
you'll be prepared to tackle any
of these application requirements.

29
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:24,399
Before we move forward, if you haven't
completed the course on conducting

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,120
a successful job search or if you
need a refresher, go back and review

31
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,359
the three things you need in order
to conduct an effective job search.

32
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,030
Know what you want, research to
understand what the employer wants, and

33
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,960
be open to opportunity.

34
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,419
Once you've got that down, let's begin.
