1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,750
As your code base grows, you may find
yourself needing to re-evaluate what

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,780
information is essential for
your documentation.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,500
Deciding what goes into your
readme is entirely up to you.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,400
But let's go over a few common sections
and then use cases in a readme.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,720
Including copyright or licensing
information, or at least a link to it,

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,460
is always a good idea,
no matter how large or small a project.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,690
By default, you retain full rights
to your code even if you don't

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,980
include a license, but it's a safer
bet to be explicit about this.

9
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,130
Often, what you really
want to do though,

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,560
is allow others to
contribute to your project.

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,920
In this case, it's super
important to include a license.

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,170
You can choose to include the full
license in your readme itself,

13
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,790
or you can link out to
it from your readme.

14
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,810
Choosing which license is a bit
beyond the scope of this course, but

15
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,530
I've included a link to a handy
resource in the instructor notes,

16
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,690
appropriately titled choosealicense.com
to help you out with this.

17
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,760
In the spirit of contribution, if you
have a preferred way for others to

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,270
contribute to your project, the readme
is the right place for that, too.

19
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,690
Briefly outlining simple steps,
a style guide or

20
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,610
whatever information you'd like
others to know about contributing,

21
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,330
is a great way to make your project more
accessible for those wanting to help.

22
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,960
Some services, like ones that check
to see if all your tests are passing,

23
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,070
will provide special graphics,
known as shields, for your readme's.

24
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,570
These shields are useful because
they're provided by a third party, and

25
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,880
let your users know helpful
information about your code.

26
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,010
If this seems a bit confusing for
now, don't worry too much about it.

27
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,030
I know when I started writing
documentation these really confused me

28
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,340
because I thought I needed to have them.

29
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,060
Once you've written lots
of tests in your code,

30
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,670
these shields will become useful.

31
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,120
But when you're just getting started,
don't worry too much about it.

32
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,700
A word of caution, don't make your life
more complicated than it needs to be.

33
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,710
Allow your documentation to
grow with the code base and

34
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,130
only add new information as needed.

35
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,740
We've looked at just a few potential
sections you might want to include in

36
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,700
your readme as you document your code
but don't limit yourself to just these.

37
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,027
As your code base grows,

38
00:01:57,027 --> 00:02:00,200
which sections might also make
sense to add to your readme?

39
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,637
Known bugs, frequently asked questions,
press that your project has received,

40
00:02:05,637 --> 00:02:09,120
a table of contents or
pictures of your cat.

41
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,500
Select as many as you think apply.
