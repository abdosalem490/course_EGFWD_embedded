So in Markdown,
we use a hash to indicate a header.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,968
We use a single hash to note
that this is in each one.

3
00:00:07,968 --> 00:00:11,920
We use backticks around our text to
indicate that this text is actually

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,080
inline code.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,330
We use two asterisks around any
text that we want to be bold.

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,710
And we use a single underscore around
any text that we want to be italicized.
