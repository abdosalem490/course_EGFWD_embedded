1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,640
This first read me belongs
to factory_girl, which is

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,170
an open source project maintained by
a development shop called thoughtbot.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,240
Without knowing the specifics of what
this project does we can see that this

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,100
file is broken up into
many small chunks.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,270
Each one of them is very
clearly defined and readable.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,970
At the top we can see some links
to more external documentation,

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,460
some installation instructions, and

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,440
then underneath we can find some
essential additional information

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,990
along with information for
how we can contribute to the project.

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:39,440
At the very bottom is
a section that links out to

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,630
the license and
all the licensing information.

12
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:47,530
So without knowing what factory_girl is
or does we can assume that if we wanted

13
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,470
to use it we'd have all the information
we'd need to get started right here.

14
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:55,460
Next we've got can.viewify, which is
a personal project by my friend Kat.

15
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,750
This one is considerably shorter, but

16
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,910
it seems to be structured in a similar
way with lots of short, clear sections.

17
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,980
We've got our description,

18
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:10,180
we've got our installation instructions,
and this is a little different.

19
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,590
We've got some usage examples here.

20
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,980
This readme does not have
contribution information, and

21
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:20,040
instead has a little section on an issue
that is known within this code,

22
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,680
and down at the bottom we once again
have some licensing information.

23
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,920
Lastly, we've got a readme
from Udacity's very

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,340
own Create-Your-Own-Adventure game,
which comes from our Git and

25
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,120
GitHub course, which you should
check out if you haven't already.

26
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,710
This readme doesn't have
too much code necessarily.

27
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:40,650
Just that one line there, but
it does have a very detailed explanation

28
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,530
of how we're supposed to
contribute to this repository.

29
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,190
Like the other two readme's we've
got some licensing information

30
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,740
at the bottom as well.

31
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,830
So, without knowing anything about
the actual code within each of these

32
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:54,760
projects we can see that all three of
these readme's gives us a quick overview

33
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,230
of the essential information we may need
to get these projects up and running.

34
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:02,430
In the next few sections we're
going to be talking about

35
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,440
each of these sections in more detail.
