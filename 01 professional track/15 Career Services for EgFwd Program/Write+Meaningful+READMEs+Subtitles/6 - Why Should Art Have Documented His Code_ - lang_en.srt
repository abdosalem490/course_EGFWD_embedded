1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,490
So, I told you earlier that sometimes
you might be the end user of your

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:04,939
own documentation.

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:07,900
I'm here with Art,
director of engineering here at Udacity.

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,660
So Art, tell me a horror story.

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,662
Tell me a time when you're
really kicking yourself for

6
00:00:11,662 --> 00:00:13,720
not writing documentation.

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,900
>> That's a good question, Walter.

8
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,656
Feedbacks, early in my career.

9
00:00:18,656 --> 00:00:20,147
I was doing a project for

10
00:00:20,147 --> 00:00:24,408
a very sort of conservative stuffy
investment bank on Wall Street.

11
00:00:24,408 --> 00:00:28,555
And I was doing the support
screen that comes up like,

12
00:00:28,555 --> 00:00:32,409
if somebody that's using
the app needs help.

13
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,990
They click help and
it comes up with a phone number.

14
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:38,770
But we didn't yet have the phone number,
so like a placeholder phone number.

15
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,367
But I forgot to put in the read me,

16
00:00:40,367 --> 00:00:43,288
that somebody needed to update
that before they shipped it.

17
00:00:43,288 --> 00:00:46,778
So I just put in the first
thing that popped into my mind,

18
00:00:46,778 --> 00:00:51,556
which was 1-900 of the name of
the company, we'll say, ABC-4EVA.

19
00:00:51,556 --> 00:00:53,476
>> [LAUGH]
>> 4EVA, right?

20
00:00:53,476 --> 00:00:54,256
>> Yeah.

21
00:00:54,256 --> 00:00:57,840
>> And I shipped it, I collect my fee,
don't think anything of it.

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,680
Six months later, I get this frantic
call from the project manager.

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,280
Freaking out because one of their
customers had called the number,

24
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,872
nobody ever updated the help number.

25
00:01:05,872 --> 00:01:08,272
This guy calls me up and he's like,

26
00:01:08,272 --> 00:01:12,758
why did you put an adult 900 number
on the help screen of our app?

27
00:01:12,758 --> 00:01:16,180
Because I had forgotten to document
that it was just a placeholder and

28
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,657
somebody in Utah updated it.

29
00:01:17,657 --> 00:01:20,914
[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]
>> No, God.

30
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:26,893
[LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH] That's not even a true story.

31
00:01:26,893 --> 00:01:31,090
[LAUGH] You'd never do
something like that, right?

32
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,030
>> I know, I know.

33
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,730
Yeah, I would never.

34
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:34,436
>> What is-

35
00:01:34,436 --> 00:01:38,636
[MUSIC]

36
00:01:38,636 --> 00:01:39,910
>> I'm future Walter, and

37
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,828
I completely agree with
everything you just said, Art.

38
00:01:42,828 --> 00:01:45,417
Present Walter over here forgot
to document the code on some

39
00:01:45,417 --> 00:01:47,189
of the projects we've been working on.

40
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:49,950
And now, we can't seem to
remember what we were thinking.

41
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,801
>> Walter, I'm so disappointed.

42
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:55,681
[MUSIC]

43
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:58,450
>> Take a look at some of
your own older projects.

44
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,280
Can you remember everything that you
were thinking when you were writing

45
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,480
that code.

46
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,448
Wouldn't it be helpful to have a handy
reference of all the decisions that

47
00:02:05,448 --> 00:02:06,181
past you made.
