00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,830
Hey, I'm Walter, your instructor.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,360
After learning all the cool
things you can do with code,

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,189
writing documentation
might seem a bit stale.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,070
I'm here to show you why that's,
in fact, not the case and

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,940
why you should get excited
about documenting your code.

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,410
In this course you'll be cooking
up your very own readme file.

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,150
You'll learn what documentation is and

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,860
why it's an important part of
the development process and

9
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,970
you'll be able to incorporate it
into your projects moving forward.

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,760
This course is relevant to
anyone who either writes code or

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,390
works with others who do.

12
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,570
Throughout this course, you'll be
seeing examples of documentation for

13
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:39,780
a variety of tools and languages, some
will be familiar and others will not.

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,080
That's okay.

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,730
Focus on the concepts, not the actual
code that we'll be documenting.

16
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,650
To help us get started, I've cooked
up a little something for you.

17
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,047
How does this relate to readme's?

18
00:00:50,047 --> 00:00:51,500
Well, you'll understand in a minute.
