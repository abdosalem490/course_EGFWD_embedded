1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,700
All right, so now we know we need
to be documenting our own projects.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,340
But all the documentation we've
looked at so far is pretty intense.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:07,840
In fact, for

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,490
a small personal project, the type
of documentation is often overkill.

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:17,080
It would be like writing a cook book
when all you need is a single recipe.

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,820
Luckily, there's a type of documentation
that lends itself well to small

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,814
projects, known as a readme file.

8
00:00:22,858 --> 00:00:25,470
A readme file's a convention that's
existed since back when computer

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,690
programs were written with punch cards.

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,370
This single file contains
relevant information

11
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,100
about the other files in
a project's directory.

12
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,920
Readmes are so
common that you may have encountered one

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,380
of your own in the past when
installing something on your computer.

14
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,876
Its name exists, usually written in all
caps to stand out in a directory so

15
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:46,350
that users would be
more likely to read it.

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,697
Check it out for yourself.

17
00:00:47,697 --> 00:00:51,390
I've included a link to three different
readmes in the instructor notes.

18
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,390
As you examine them,

19
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:56,100
think to yourself, what information
is being communicated in this file?

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,670
And how is this information
being structured?

21
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,670
And do you notice any patterns
across these readmes?
